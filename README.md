# post.py
Got a phishing email and I decided to flood them with posts. I probably should've slowed it down, because it took down the site in less than a minute.

I know this isn't commented well (I made this on my break at work), but the commented portion is for logging if you want to see the bogus data you're dumping.

This uses Requests and MultiThreading to dump a ton of data all at once. I'd maybe dial down the threads though... 50 killed the server pretty quick.

I also used ChatGPT to help me a good bit because I have never used the Requests library before.
